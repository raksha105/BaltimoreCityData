# Restaurants in Baltimore

This is a full stack web application, that uses data provided by OpenBaltimore, specifically, the Restaurants data.
The data is loaded from the URL end point, through their REST API.

This data is then loaded to an RDS instance that I created on AWS.

This data is then used for CRUD operations in Hibernate.

You can do the following through the User Interface:

1. Load data to the database

2. Perform Insert/Update

3. View data

4. Sort data

5. Perform search on data
## Getting Started

1. IDE - Preferrably Eclipse IDE
